Game Idea:

The ghost starts off with three hearts

Ghost goes in the right direction and can only jump 

There will be obstacles in the ghost's way 

If the ghost passes the obstacles without touching it, we add a score (100) (The obstacles are pumpkins)

Every the score gets higher, the speed randomly gets higher (there is a range on how fast it can go)

If the ghost touches the obstacles, then the ghost loses a heart

After:

We can add like shop or something
